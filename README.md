## Introduction
Conti is a Russian hacker group that took part in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict alongside Vladimir Putin with the aim of working against Ukrainian forces by carrying out sabotage actions targeting several strategic infrastructures. In order to slow down the group's activities, an anonymous user known as @ContiLeaks decided to gather on a Twitter account all the messages exchanged between Conti members during the year 2020.

## Projects
The goal of this project was to retrieve all the members of Conti who had participated in the exchanges, to see to whom they had sent messages and from whom they had received them, to store all these data in a database in order to subsequently draw up a graph of relations between all the members of Conti. This graph could, for example, highlight the important members of the group as well as the main information flows.

## WARNING
Some parts of the code have been decommented in order not to iterate on all the .json files available and to facilitate data acquisition. Indeed, it is possible to retrieve nearly 8 million messages which represents a large amount of data. You are free to uncomment these parts to extract everything.

## Version
Made with Python 3.8.0
